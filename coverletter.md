I am an enthusiastic individual with an aptitude in creativity. I specialize in illustration and graphic design, and have done freelance work for both commercial and personal-use commissions to very happy customers. My past projects have included album cover design, poster design, magazine graphics/layout design, mural design, original character commission/custom art, as well as various personal projects involving character design and world-building. 

As a person, I am responsible and punctual. I am a fast learner, am enthusiastic and cordial - excellent for a team that needs an upbeat and optimistic attitude. I'm flexible and adaptable; if work requires learning new skills, I am certainly more than eager to do so!

I look to actualize my skills in a commercial context, where I can work 20 hours per week and balance with my student life. For a further overview of my skills, do visit my [CV](https://registry.jsonresume.org/rrrach).
